# Datadog APM(Tracing) Logging Examples for Kubernetes

This repo showcases examples in different languages on using [Datadog APM (Tracing)](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/) with [Datadog Log Management](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/). Please note all the examples has a strong focus on using Kubernetes as the running environment.

For each language (we will keep adding more), `deploy/` directory contains the deployment files to Kubernetes.
